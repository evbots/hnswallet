## What is Handshake?

Handshake is a new blockchain that allows permissionless naming on the internet. [Handshake.org](https://handshake.org) explains that this blockchain seeks to "replace the root zone file and the root servers with a public commons." What does this mean in practical terms? Individuals will be able to personally own top level names on the internet. Examples of top level names in the current domain name system are "com", "net", and "org".

Handshake is currently under development and is currently running as a test net. A main net release is imminent.

### How can I use Handshake?

Run the software yourself and experience the joy of self-reliance. [Check out the Github org](https://github.com/handshake-org).

You can also use wallets that take custody of your funds. One such option at the moment is [Namebase](https://namebase.io/).
